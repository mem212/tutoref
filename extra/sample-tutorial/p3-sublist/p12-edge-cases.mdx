Edge cases can be defined as a subset of tests that check extreme limits of valid input values.
Testing edge cases reduces the chances of getting errors in production code since errors tend to arise at extreme conditions.

To illustrate this we will use the following Counter class. 
It does simply hold the count of clients inside a store and offer methods to increase, decrease and get the clients count.

```java
public class Counter {

    public final static int MAX_CAPACITY = 2000;

    private int count; // implicitly initialized to Zero

    public void increaseCount() throws MaximumCapacityReachedException {
        if(MAX_CAPACITY == count){
            throw new MaximumCapacityReachedException();
        }
        count++;
    }

    public void decreaseCount() throws MinimumCapacityReachedException {
        if(MAX_CAPACITY == 0){
            throw new MinimumCapacityReachedException();
        }
        count--;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }

}

```

### Example

The following unit tests are not really bad like the title suggests, but they are not enough.
They simply validate the basic use cases of the counter which are the count increment, decrement and initialization.


```java
class EdgeCasesTest {

    Counter counter;

    @BeforeEach
    void init(){
        counter = new Counter();
    }

    @Test
    void counterInitializedToZero(){

        final int INIT_VALUE = 0;

        assertEquals(INIT_VALUE, counter.getCount());
    }

    @Test
    void increaseNum_Increment_By_One_When_Invoked() throws MaximumCapacityReachedException {

        final int EXPECTED_VALUE = 1;

        counter.increaseCount();

        assertEquals(EXPECTED_VALUE, counter.getCount());
    }

    @Test
    void decreaseNum_Decrement_By_One_When_Invoked() throws MaximumCapacityReachedException {

        final int EXPECTED_VALUE = 1;

        counter.decreaseCount();

        assertEquals(EXPECTED_VALUE, counter.getCount());
    }
}

```

However, you should ask questions like :
- What happens if we try to increment the counter after reaching the limit;
- What happens if we try to decrement the counter right after the instantiation (count == 0);
- Any other edge cases ?


### Improved example

To address the previous problem we can add test cases to cover those edge cases.
For the example we will just make sure we get the appropriate exception.

```java

@Test
void increaseCount_Throws_MaximumCapacityReachedException_When_Max_Val_Reached(){

    // Note: There is no setter ion the example above but you can add one
    counter.setCount(Counter.MAX_CAPACITY);

    assertThrows(
            MaximumCapacityReachedException.class,
            ()->counter.increaseCount()
    );

}

@Test
void decreaseCount_Throws_MinimumCapacityReachedException_When_Count_Is_Zero(){

    // Note : Counter is implicitly initialized to Zero when instantiated.

    assertThrows(
            MinimumCapacityReachedException.class,
            ()->counter.decreaseCount()
    );

}
```
