## Types of wallets

Before diving into the comparison of wallets, you should know - or you already know - that there are many types of crypto wallets as detailed in the following.

- **1 - Hot wallets** 
    - They generally connect to Internet and include all the **Software wallets**. They have 3 sub-types.
        - ** a - Desktop wallets:** Applications that you install on a computer. They store your keys on the computer local storage or on a flash drive.
        - ** b - Mobile wallets:** Apps that you install on your mobile device. Like the Desktop wallets they store your keys on the local device it self which means that you are the owner of your keys.
        - ** c - Web wallets:** Web applications that you access through a web browser ( or a client app connected to a web service). Unlike to two previous types of wallets, your keys are stored on a server. 
- **2 - Cold wallets**
    - ** a - Hardware wallets:** They store your private keys on a hardware device that was specially designed for cryptocurrency transactions. Hardware wallets use a 2 factor authentication ( 2FA ). In order to access your funds you have to prove your identity trough the wallet you are physically holding and by providing the PIN code for the wallet. Hardware wallets are a serious choice if security is very important for you.
    - ** b - Paper wallets:** A paper wallet are piece of paper that contain all the information needed to access your cryptocurrency, it contains printed versions of your public and private keys. It can also contain QR codes of the codes to make it easy to use them.
