# UML Tutorial
## Introduction

### Summary

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard graphical language created by the Object Management Group (OMG) to visualize, specify, communicate, construct and document software systems.

Version 1.0 of UML was first introduced in January 1997. This tutorial covers the version 2.5.1 of UML which contains 14 diagrams that can be organized in two categories.

**1 - Structural diagrams**

Structural diagrams show the static structure of the objects in a system independently of time. The elements in a structural diagram represent the meaningful concepts of a system, it may include abstract, real world and implementation details. 

Structural diagrams do not show the details of dynamic behaviors, but they may show relationships to the behaviors of the classifiers included in the structure diagrams.

**2 - Behavioral diagrams**

Behavioral diagrams show the dynamic behavior of the objects in a system, including their methods, collaborations,
activities, and state transitions.

### Prerequisites

No specific skills are mandatory. General knowledge of software development process and object oriented programming are nice to have.
