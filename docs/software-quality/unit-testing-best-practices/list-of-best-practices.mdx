## Write trustworthy unit tests

A trustworthy unit test is a test you can trust. It means that it should fail when the code is broken, and succeed when - and only when - the code behaves like expected. 

If these two conditions are not met then our unit test is trustworthy.


## Write descriptive unit tests

readable + simple
talk about naming conventions

A unit test should be descriptive. If a colleague is reading your test case then he/she sould undestand what that test aims to validates and how, without spending much effort.



In addition to the above, coding conventions and programming best practices that you put in practice when developing production code still apply when you write unit tests.
 This will make your unit tests more readable and clean.

## Arrange Act Assert

Arrange-Act-Assert AAA = Arrange Act Assert = well structured


## Avoid multiple acts

talk about multiple assertions

## Test one thing at a time

talk about multiple assertions

Test a single unit of code

## Write isolated unit tests

talk about multiple assertions

## Write fast unit tests

## Avoid logic in unit tests

## Test public methods

Validate private methods using public methods. Test only public methods.

## Cover the maximum you can

	types of coverage
		line + branch

## Avoid magic values

## No side effects
