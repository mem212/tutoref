Unit tests should run in complete isolation. When you write a unit test make sure it does not depend on any external resource or other unit tests.
Examples of external resources can be a database, the file system, a REST or SOAP web service, etc.

When the component under test has a hard dependency on a resource (it cannot be run without it), you can create a "fake" copy of the dependency and define its behavior for each test case. This practice is called **Mocking** and many libraries and frameworks make it possible to mock dependencies and define their behavior.
Powermock, Mockito and Easymock are example of libraries you can use with JUnit/Java .

### Example

Consider the following java class which represents a "simplified" BankAccount.

```java
public class BankAccount {

    private AccountService accountService;

    public BankAccount(AccountService accountService){
        this.accountService = AccountService();
    }

    public BigDecimal getBalance(Integer accountNumber) {
        return accountService.getBalance(accountNumber);
    }
}
```

In the following test is not isolated. Why ? we want to test that the BankAccount.getBalance() method returns the correct balance. 
We do not care about the AccountService class here (Remember, Test one thing at a time). However, the test class seems to create a real instance of AccountService.
This can cause problems since we depend on a "real" service even if it is "dev" service. 
Moreover, Running against a real service can corrupt data or create unwanted side effects.

```java
class BankAccountTest {

    private AccountService accountService;
    private BankAccount bankAccountInstance;
    private final Integer ACCOUNT_NUMBER = 123456789;
    

    @BeforeEach
    void init(){
      accountService = AccountService.getInstance(); // Real instance !
      bankAccountInstance = new BankAccount(accountService);
    }

    @Test
    void getBalance_Should_Return_Correct_Balance(){
        final BigDecimal EXPECTED_AMT = 100.00;

        BigDecimal actualBalance = bankAccountInstance.getBalance(ACCOUNT_NUMBER);

        assertEquals(EXPECTED_AMT, actualBalance);
    }
```

### Improved example

To improve the BankAccountTest class we can mock the AccountService class like in the following example.

```java
class BankAccountTest {

    @Mock
    private AccountService accountServiceMock;

    private BankAccount bankAccountInstance;
    private final Integer ACCOUNT_NUMBER = 123456789;
    

    @BeforeEach
    void init(){
      accountServiceMock = mock(AccountService.class); // create a mock
      bankAccountInstance = new BankAccount(accountServiceMock); // Use the mock
      when(accountServiceMock.getBalance(ACCOUNT_NUMBER)).thenReturn(EXPECTED_AMT); // Define the behavior
    }

    @Test
    void getBalance_Should_Return_Correct_Balance(){
        final BigDecimal EXPECTED_AMT = 100.00;

        BigDecimal actualBalance = bankAccountInstance.getBalance(ACCOUNT_NUMBER);

        assertEquals(EXPECTED_AMT, actualBalance);
    }
```
